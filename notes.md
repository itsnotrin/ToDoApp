# Notes for the app:

What type of database to use? 
MongoDB - Fast but less secure
MySQL - Well documented, Well known, slower than others but just gets the job done.
MariaDB - Fork of MySQL, Tends to have better performance (around 24%)
PostgreSQL - Fastest but lacks documentation 
Sqlite - Fastest out of all, I have the most experience and supports concurrency with good documentation. 

I'll use use sqlite as I'm the most comfortable with it, it's the fastest and has the a good community with very helpful documentation.
